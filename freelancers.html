<h2><b>Home Page</b></h2>


    <p><br><br>RightGigs is an independent e-commerce platform created by three spirited entrepreneurs that allows employment for artists, designers and freelancers from
various firms, businesses and individual employers.</p>
    <p><br><br>Designers can exhibit their work and companies can ask for commissions and 
        negotiate with the artist off-site. Through various distinct search filters, employers
        can narrow the copious proportion of artists down to a few, specific to their 
        requirements.</p>
    <p><br><br>The website will take a fixed percentage per commission, but signing up and 
        registering will be free. All artists and companies will be licensed and authorized 
        and will have some legal identification to submit while registering.</p>
